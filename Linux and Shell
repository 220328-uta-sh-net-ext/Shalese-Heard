Execute commands using these three parts

1. The command
2. Options that typically start with a ```-``` or ```--```
3. Argument

The Bash shell understands the following commands:

* **Aliases** such as ```ll```
* **Keywords** such as ```if```
* **Functions**
* **Built in** such as ```pwd```
* **Files** such as ```/bin/date```
