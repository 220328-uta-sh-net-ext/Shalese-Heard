## **History of Linux and shell**
Shell is a commonly used term in Linux operating systems. It is the interface between the operating user system adn you, providing access to services of a Kernal. Ultimately, it executes commands.n the operating user system adn you, providing access to services of a KernaLinix began in 1991, by a Finnish student Linus Torvalds, as a new operating system kernal. It started off as a private source of codes, but eventually became a major source of codes open to tthe public. in 1991, by a Finnish student Linus Torvalds, as a new operating sys## **Getting Started With Shell Programming**e of codes, but eventually became a major source of codes open to tthe public.
### **Introduction to Shell Programming**
A shell program, sometimes referred to as a shell script1, is simply a program constructed of shell commands. Shell programs are interpreted each time they are run. This means each command is processed (i.e. executed) by the shell a single line at a time.
shell programs consist of one or more primitive shell commands
shell programs are created using your text editor of choice, e.g. vi or emacs
shell programs are executed just as shell commands are, by typing the name of the program followed by the [Enter] key
shell programs have permission modes as do any other file, and must have the correct permissions set to execute the program
as with other programming languages, the shell language has the functionality to allow input & output, iteration, logical decision making, file creation and deletion, and system call capability
shell programs are free format, as long as the syntax of each shell command is correct. This means that blank lines, indentation and abundant whitespace can be used freely
### **Shell Environment**
A shell maintains an environment that includes a set of variables defined by a login program. There are two types of variables here: environmental and local variables. 
1. Environmental Variables are exported to all processes spawned by the shell. An example of this is the PATH variable.
2. Local variables only affect the current shell. They are related to the corresponding enviromental shell. Examples include: user,term, home and path.

Shell Variables Descriptions:

* **Lang** sets the locale.
* **MAIL** sets path to user's mailbox
* **Manpath**Sets the hierarchies of man pages that are available. 
* **prompt** defines shell path for the C Shell
* **LPDEST** sets to user's default printer

Types of Shells
1. C Shell
2. Bourne or Korn Shell
